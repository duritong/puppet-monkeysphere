puppet module for monkeysphere

for information about monkeysphere, see http://web.monkeysphere.info/

To install the monkeypshere module:

* storeconfigs must be enabled in your puppet server. see:
  http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/1/wiki/Using_Stored_Configuration#Configuring+basic+storeconfigs

* copy the code to a directory named "monkeysphere" in the modules
  directory of your puppet install.  This will usually be
  /etc/puppetd/modules/monkeysphere

* add the following line to modules.pp:

  import "monkeysphere"

* in node definitions that should export a ssh host key via
  monkeyshere, add:

  include monkeysphere::sshserver

* You can specify pgpids of identity certifiers:

  identity_certifier { "A3AE44A4":
    ensure => present
  }

A host can be configured as a host you would use to sign the gpg keys by placing:

  include monkeysphere::signer

into the node definition. ON this host, a file will be placed in
/var/lib/puppet/monkeysphere/hosts for each host configured as a
sshserver.  Each file will contin the gpg id, the gpg fingerprint, and
the ssh fingerprint of the sshserver.
